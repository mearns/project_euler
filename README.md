# project_euler

**SPOILER ALERT**

Project Euler is meant to be an individual challenge, using someone else's
solutions defeats the purpose of it. I really just posted them here so I can
reference them later.

## Purpose

This repo is my collection of solutions to challenges on
(project euler)[https://projecteuler.net/]. I'm using it primarily as a way to
learn new programming languages, so you'll probably notice a lot of the code
is fairly poor quality, and that the solutions are non-optimal.
